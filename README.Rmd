# Overview

`Shiny_qraLm` is a **Shiny web application** designed for the **quantitative risk assessment** of *Listeria monocytogenes* in various food categories.  

The application is available: [https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/Shiny_qraLm/](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/Shiny_qraLm/)

The tool supports risk modeling for:
- **Frozen Vegetables**
- **Cold-Smoked Fish**
- **RTE Cantaloupe**

The application is built using the [`qraLm`](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/qraLm/) R package and was developed under the scope of the [Joint FAO/WHO Expert Meeting on Microbiological Risk Assessment](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/jemra-of-listeria-monocytogenes-in-foods).

📄 **Reference Document:** [FAO/WHO Summary Report](https://www.fao.org/3/cc6993en/cc6993en.pdf)  
🔗 **GitHub Repository:** [Shiny_qraLm](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/Shiny_qraLm)


## Key Features

**Interactive Modeling** – Run risk assessment models in real-time  
**Modular Architecture** – Scalable and extensible codebase  
**Data Visualization** – Advanced `ggplot2` and `plotly` charts  
**Live Updates** – Dynamic risk level calculations  
**Downloadable Reports** – Export results in various formats  



## Getting Started

### Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have R and the required packages installed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install required packages
required_packages <- c("shiny", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plotly", "shinyjs", "DT", "shinyWidgets")

new_packages <- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

lapply(required_packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

### Running the App

Once dependencies are installed, start the application:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
setwd("path/to/Shiny_qraLm")  # Set your working directory
shiny::runApp("app.R")  # Run the app
```


# Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular architecture, making it easy to manage, extend, and customize.

## Key Components

- **`app.R`**: Main entry point that initializes the UI and server logic.
- **`data/`**: Contains datasets for risk assessments.
- **`modules/`**: Stores reusable Shiny UI components for modular development.
- **`pages/`**: Organizes the UI and server logic for each section of the app.
- **`www/`**: Holds static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## FAQ
### How do I run the app locally?

Clone the repository:

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/Shiny_qraLm.git
```

Install required packages in R (see Installation section above). Start the app:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.
